While the main purpose of Agile Handoffs is to produce more efficient work and improve collaboration, I've found that the effort put in can be easily worthless if you choose to omit one key element:

** Writing insightful commit messages. **

I've found that taking the time to write out an informative message when committing changes can improve communication between teams or between your present and past self. When working on projects, I try to commit changes with a message clearly summarizing changes made or changes that need to be made in future work. This can be essential especially when working in multiple branches in GitHub, or when trying to resolve an issue, etc.
