Many organizations utilize multiple teams who work collectively on a single project. Traditionally, each team would be given a singular piece of the project to complete, handing off the project in succession until the project reaches completion. This form of collaboration can severely impact efficiency and even increase the amount of mistakes made. 

To improve this process, *Agile handoffs* are utilized in the field to improve project handoffs between teams such as designers to developers, developers to testers, etc. The [Agile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/plan/what-is-agile) method of handing off a project prioritizes incremental development to produce high quality results. While there is stressed importance on handoffs between teams, **self-handoffs are just as important.** This is because you can easily confuse your present self with work that your past self completed. One of the easiest ways to confuse yourself with a past development is **poor communication**.

I've personally found while establishing an application in GitHub that it is crucial to write **clear and informative commit messages** so that I can
I am handing off my project to ensure my future self understands exactly what I did last and what I need to do. Regardless of the time it takes to write out a commit message, it can improve workflow and minimize misunderstandings when picking up a project after an hour or even a few days.

Some people may believe that [too many handoffs can be detrimental](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/handoffs-hurt). It is true that passing a project from hand-to-hand too many times could only further complicate matters and increase miscommunication. However, it's could also be stated that the number of hand-offs should be ["as small and frequent as possible"](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/new-to-agile-or-scrum/agile-teamwork?). 

It's difficult for me to say what method would work best for teams, but when doing self-handoffs I personally find that small and frequent increments remind me to keep my work as current as possible and will be how I continue to work in the future.
